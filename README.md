Hi, my name is Ac치cio Os칩rio, but you can also call me Samurai. Ive been a Frontend Developer since before the term existed. Passion for tech world since the days of dial-up Internet, Im always looking to learn something new. 游녦

My earliest coding experience I remember was creating scripts for mIRC (how the olds communicated). Design, Illustration, and Animations, I witnessed the rise and fall of Flash, became a Frontend Developer in 2010, and Im currently taking steps towards Fullstack Development.

游눫 I usually say:
```bash
If theres documentation and a deadline, anything can be done.
```
